It distinguishes you from the interpretations you have about life in general, yourself in particular and about the specific outcome you are wanting. Coaching empowers you to shift those interpretations, which no longer serve you. It also empowers you to practice new ways of being that align with your desires in order to reach your highest potential. It is transformational in nature because it focuses on the states of being that generate actions, which either move you closer to your desired outcomes or further away. Shifting how you are being, rather than what you are doing, will create transformation, because the way you are being is transferable to every other aspect of you life. You transform you perspective, shifting your paradigm to include more, which allows an expanded repertoire of possibilities to exist.</p><h1>Outcome Oriented</h1><p>The focus of coaching, any type of coaching, is on the desired outcome or results. It focuses on where you are in this present moment, how you want to be, where you want to be, and how you want to get there. The outcome is something that is tangible and measurable. For instance, a client who is desiring more peace in his life might be asked: “How will you know when you have the level of peace you want? What will be present or absent when there is more peace?” In other words, you need to have some tangible and measurable indicators so that we will know when we have met our target. You may say that when I have more peace I will experience more balance in my life. I will have more time with my children, more intimacy with your partner and more quality time with yourself. You will make time for exercise and being in nature. These are tangible results that can be seen and measured.</p><p>With the desired outcome clear, a coach listens to what you are saying and distinguishes whether what you are saying, and what you are doing, is in alignment with the desired outcome. The degree to which the you are committed to that outcome is the degree to which you will be willing to hear the distinctions the coach is making and generate or choose new ways of being that align you with the stated outcome. Your willingness to practice taking actions that result in having fulfilled the commitment will also become clearer over time.</p><span>"How will you know when you have the level of peace you want? What will be present or absent when there is more peace? In other words, you need to have some tangible and measurable indicators so that we will know when we have met our target."</span><p>Eastern spiritual traditions suggest that it is best to desire no desire in order to reach enlightenment and live without suffering. This desire for no desire is a desire, none the less.</p><p>It is our relationship to our desires that creates suffering. Millions of individuals suffer from having desires, having them fulfilled and from having them unfulfilled. The fulfilment of desires is not a bad thing. If it was, then the fulfilment for the desire for peace, the desire for enlightenment and the desire to end desires would also be seen as something other than good.</p><p>Noticing the relationship you have with your desires allows you to observe how you are being with them. Are you being demanding, greedy, impatient and untrusting? Or, are you being open, allowing, and unattached to the outcome? Again, it’s important to distinguish the desire from how you are being with the desire.</p><p>Awaken →  Empower → Evolve</p><h1>The Process</h1><p>The process begins by expressing an interest in working together through an email at<a data-ng-href="mailto:hello@zissisliolios.com">hello@zissisliolios.com</a>.
